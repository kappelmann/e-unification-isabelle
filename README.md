# E-Unification

1. First-order and higher-order pattern E-unification and E-matching for Isabelle with theorem certificates.
2. Resolution tactic with adjustable unifier

## Build

Requirements:
1. The Isabelle development version
2. The AFP development version
3. This [Isabelle/ML logging framework](https://github.com/kappelmann/logger-isabelle)

## Future Tasks

1. Add higher-order unifier E-unification and matching
2. use more efficient data structures
3. build erule and drule tactics
4. tests:
    - adapt test to work for open terms
    - for unification hints: check if order of premises = order of solver
