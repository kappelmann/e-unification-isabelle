# E-Unification

1. First-order and higher-order pattern E-unification and E-matching for Isabelle with theorem certificates.
2. Resolution tactic with adjustable unifier

## Build

Requirements:
1. The Isabelle development version
2. The AFP development version 
3. This [Isabelle/ML logging framework](https://github.com/kappelmann/logger-isabelle)

## Open Tasks

0. Add higher-order unifier E-unification and matching
1. use more efficient data structures
2. build erule and drule tactics
3. tests for unification hints: check if order of premises = order of solver
