# E-Unification

First-order and higher-order pattern E-unification and E-matching for Isabelle with theorem certificates.

## Build

You need to download the latest afp development version to `../afp-devel/` (or update the path in `ROOTS`)
and use the Isabelle release version to build the sessions.

## Open Tasks

0. Add higher-order unifier
1. use more efficient data structures
2. build tactic
3. tests for unification hints: check if order of premises = order of solver
